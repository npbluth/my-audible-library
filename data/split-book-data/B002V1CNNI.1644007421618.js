But he gets rescued by two movie producers who want to make a movie based on his memoir. When they start fictionalizing Don's life for film - changing a meandering memoir into a structured narrative - the real-life Don starts a journey to edit his actual life into a better story. <p><i>A Million Miles in a Thousand Years</i> details that journey and challenges listeners to reconsider what they strive for in life. It shows how to get a second chance at life the first time around.</p>";
