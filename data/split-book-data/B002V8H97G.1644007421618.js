window.bookSummaryJSON = "During the Holocaust at the German concentration camp near Plaszow, thousands of Jews lost their lives at the hands of the Nazis. More than a thousand others were spared thanks to a womanizing, heavy-drinking, German-Catholic industrialist and Nazi Party member named Oskar Schindler. One of the most remarkable narratives of the Holocaust, <i>Schindler's List</i> masterfully recreates the daring exploits of Schindler, who used his enormous fortune to build a factory near the concentration camp and his influence to save the lives of more than 1,300 Jews. It is an absorbing, suspenseful, and moving account of Schindler's legacy of life.";
