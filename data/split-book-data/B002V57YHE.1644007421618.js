window.bookSummaryJSON = "From the author who collaborated with Tom Clancy on <i>Red Storm Rising</i>, this is the book that dares to show us the military hardware, global upheavals, and raw combat a second Korean War would unleash. How F-16s would blast across the 38th Parallel. How ultra-modern submarines would vie for the seas. And how two armies would turn the snowfields of Asia red with blood. A thundering geopolitical thriller of vast scope, this is <i>Red Phoenix</i> - and a new standard for military/political suspense fiction.";
