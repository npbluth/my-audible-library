window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The only comprehensive, firsthand account of the 13-hour firefight at the Battle of Keating, by Medal of Honor recipient Clinton Romesha, for listeners of </b><b><i>Black Hawk Down</i></b><b> by Mark Bowden and </b><b><i>Lone Survivor</i></b><b> by Marcus Luttrell.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>\"'It doesn't get better.' To us, that phrase nailed one of the essential truths, maybe even <i>the</i> essential truth, about being stuck at an outpost whose strategic and tactical vulnerabilities were so glaringly obvious to every soldier who had ever set foot in that place that the name itself - Keating - had become a kind of backhanded joke.\"&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2009 Clinton Romesha of Red Platoon and the rest of the Black Knight Troop were preparing to shut down Command Outpost Keating, the most remote and inaccessible in a string of bases built by the US military in Nuristan and Kunar in the hope of preventing Taliban insurgents from moving freely back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Three years after Keating's construction, the army was finally ready to concede what the men on the ground had known immediately: It was simply too isolated and too dangerous to defend.&nbsp;</p> <p>On October 3, 2009, after years of constant smaller attacks, the Taliban finally decided to throw everything they had at Keating. The ensuing 13-hour battle - and eventual victory - cost eight men their lives.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Red Platoon</i> is the riveting firsthand account of the Battle of Keating, told by Romesha, who spearheaded both the defense of the outpost and the counterattack that drove the Taliban back beyond the wire and received the Medal of Honor for his actions.</p> <p>Includes original songs “Red Platoon” and “Remember the Fallen”</p> <p>Songs performed by Michael Connors. ℗2016 Michael Connors Music.</p> <p>\"Red Platoon\" words and music by Jim Kinsey, Michael Connors, Clint Romesha, Mike Hartnett and James Breedwell © 2016 All Rights Reserved.&nbsp;Used by Permission.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>\"Remember The Fallen\" words and music by Michael Connors, Jim Kinsey, Billy Dawson and Mike Hartnett © 2016 All Rights Reserved.&nbsp; Used by Permission.&nbsp; Executive Producer, Nemo Arms &nbsp;</p>";
