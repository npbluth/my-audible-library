window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Two days before Christmas 1996, the broken, battered body of Sophie Toscan du Plantier was found outside her vacation home in West Cork, a serene region on Ireland’s idyllic southern coast. Decades later, no one has been charged with the murder, but the aggrieved inhabitants of West Cork are convinced they know who did it - and he still lives among them.</p> <p>In this haunting and heartbreaking true crime series, reporter Sam Bungey and documentarian Jennifer Forde revisit the grisly homicide that left Ireland reeling. Featuring unprecedented research and extensive, exclusive interviews with the case’s key players, their work offers new insight on the still unsolved murder and the labyrinth investigation that followed. The result is an evocative audio portrait as gripping and intriguing as the case it unravels.</p>";
