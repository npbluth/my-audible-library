window.bookSummaryJSON = "Tom Hanks wrote the introduction to this rousing story of two inseparable friends and soldiers portrayed in the HBO miniseries <i>Band of Brothers</i>. <p> William \"Wild Bill\" Guarnere and Edward \"Babe\" Heffron were among the first paratroopers of the U.S. Army - members of an elite unit of the 101st Airborne Division called Easy Company. Arguably the bravest, most efficient, physically fit, and tight-knit group of soldiers the Army has ever produced, the unit was called upon for every high-risk operation of the war, including D-Day, Operation Market Garden in Holland, the Battle of the Bulge, and the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Berchtesgaden.</p> <p> Both fought side-by-side until Guarnere lost his leg in the Battle of the Bulge and was sent home. Heffron went on to liberate concentration camps and rake Hitler's Eagle's Nest hideout. United by their experience, the two reconnected at the war's end and have been the best of friends ever since. Their story is a tribute to the lasting bond forged between comrades in arms - and to all those who fought for freedom.</p>";
