window.bookSummaryJSON = "Perhaps Blackwood's most celebrated story, <i>The Willows</i> was influenced heavily by his own trips down the Danube River. It tells the story of two campers who pick the wrong place to sleep for the night, a place where another dimension impinges on our own. H.P. Lovecraft considered this the finest supernatural tale in English literature.";
