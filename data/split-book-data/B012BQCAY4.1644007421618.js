window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Bream Gives Me Hiccups</i> is the whip-smart fiction debut of Academy Award-nominated actor Jesse Eisenberg. Known for his iconic film roles but also for his regular pieces in the <i>New Yorker</i> and his two critically acclaimed plays, Eisenberg is an emerging literary voice. </p> <p>Taking its title from a group of stories that begin the book, <i>Bream Gives Me Hiccups</i> moves from contemporary LA to the dorm rooms of an American college to ancient Pompeii, throwing the reader into a universe of social misfits, reimagined scenes from history, and ridiculous overreactions. In one piece, a tense email exchange between a young man and his girlfriend is taken over by his sister, who is obsessed with the Bosnian genocide (\"The situation reminds me of a little historical blip called the Karadordevo agreement\"); in another, a college freshman forced to live with a roommate is stunned when one of her ramen packets goes missing (\"She didn't have <i>one</i> of my ramens. She had a chicken ramen\"); in another piece Alexander Graham Bell has teething problems with his invention (\"I've been calling Mabel all day, she doesn't pick up! Yes, of course I dialed the right number - two!\"). </p> <p>United by Eisenberg's gift for humor and character, the witty pieces collected in <i>Bream Gives Me Hiccups</i> explore the various insanities of the modern world and mark the arrival of a fantastically funny, self-ironic, and original voice. </p>";
