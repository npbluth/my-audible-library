window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When a young woman clears out her deceased grandmother’s home in rural North Carolina, she finds long-hidden secrets about a strange colony of beings in the woods in this chilling novel that comes across like </b><b><i>The Blair Witch Project </i></b><b>meets </b><b><i>The Andy Griffith Show</i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>When Mouse’s dad asks her to clean out her dead grandmother's house, she says yes. After all, how bad could it be?</p> <p>Answer: pretty bad. Grandma was a hoarder, and her house is stuffed with useless rubbish. That would be horrific enough, but there’s more - Mouse stumbles across her step-grandfather’s journal, which at first seems to be filled with nonsensical rants...until Mouse encounters some of the terrifying things he described for herself.</p> <p>Alone in the woods with her dog, Mouse finds herself face-to-face with a series of impossible terrors - because sometimes, the things that go bump in the night are real, and they’re looking for you. And if she doesn’t face them head-on, she might not survive to tell the tale.</p> <p>From Hugo Award-winning author Ursula Vernon, writing as T. Kingfisher, <i>The Twisted Ones </i>is a gripping, terrifying tale bound to keep you up all night - from both fear and anticipation of what happens next.</p>";
