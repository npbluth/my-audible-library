Over one million copies sold!</b></p> <p><b>Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results</b></p> <p>No matter your goals, <i>Atomic Habits</i> offers a proven framework for improving - every day.

Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.</p> <p>Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, listeners will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.</p> <p>Learn how to:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy)</li> <li>Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower</li> <li>Design your environment to make success easier</li> <li>Get back on track when you fall off course</li> <li>And much more</li> </ul> <p><i>Atomic Habits</i> will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits - whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.</p>";
