window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In 1993, John C. Maxwell's now-classic work revolutionized the way leaders are made. By examining the differences between leadership styles, Maxwell outlines principles for inspiring, motivating, and influencing others from any type of leadership position - including as a business executive, a church leader, a teacher, or even a parent.</p> <p>Now, the author has returned to his best seller to include the leadership insights and practices he has learned in the decades since the book first appeared. Thoroughly revised and with two additional chapters, <i>Developing the Leader Within You 2.0</i> has updated these foundational principles and promises to provide for both new listeners as well as longtime fans of the original book the necessary wisdom to help any leader and organization succeed in fostering integrity, self-discipline, and effecting positive change.</p> <p>Develop your vision. Develop your value. Develop the leader within you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
