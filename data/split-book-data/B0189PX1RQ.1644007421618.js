window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Master one of our economy’s most rare skills and achieve groundbreaking results with this “exciting” audiobook (Daniel H. Pink) from an “exceptional” author (<i>New York Times</i> Book Review).</p> <p>Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. <i>Deep Work</i> will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive 21st century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of email and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.</p> <p>In <i>Deep Work</i>, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this audiobook into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four \"rules\", for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.</p> <ol> <li>Work Deeply</li> <li>Embrace Boredom</li> <li>Quit Social Media</li> <li>Drain the Shallows</li> </ol> <p>A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, <i>Deep Work</i> takes the listener on a journey through memorable stories - from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air-and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. <i>Deep Work</i> is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.</p> <p>An Amazon Best Book of 2016 pick in Business and Leadership.</p> <p><i>Wall Street Journal </i>Business best seller.</p> <p>A Business Book of the Week at 800-CEO-READ.</p>";
