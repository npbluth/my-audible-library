window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>More than 30 years ago, Finn Murphy dropped out of college to become a trucker. Since then he's covered hundreds of thousands of miles packing, loading, and hauling people's belongings all over America. Murphy whisks listeners down the I-95 Powerlane, across the Florida Everglades, in and out of the truck stops of the Midwest, and through the steep grades of the Rocky Mountains. He tells funny, poignant, and haunting stories of the people he moves: a hoarder in New Hampshire, a Virginia homeowner raging when Murphy's truck accidentally runs down a stand of trees, a widow rushing her archaeologist husband's remains and relics to a Navajo burial ceremony in New Mexico. Brimming with personality and great characters, <i>The Long Haul</i> explores the appeal of manual labor and shows what happens behind the scenes when we call the movers. </p>";
