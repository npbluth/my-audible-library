window.bookSummaryJSON = "In this spirited and romantic saga, a young heir named David Balfour meets his miserly uncle Ebenezer, who has illegally taken control of the Balfour estate. Ebenezer kidnaps David and plots to have him seized and sold into slavery on a ship to the Carolinas. A couple of days into the voyage, a shipwreck throws David together with David Break, a Scotsman returning from political exile in France, and the two of them journey together. They are witnesses to the murder of Colin Campbell, the \"Rio Fox\" of Glenure, and suspicion falls on them. What follows is a perilous journey across the Highlands. <i>Kidnapped</i> is a classic of high adventure.";
