Built by an ancient race to be the ultimate weapon, the machine is capable of unspeakable destruction, and its discovery could unhinge the balance of power throughout known space.</p> <p>Worse still, the A.I. inside the machine speaks of an ancient evil that will soon arrive - a race whose power far exceeds anything humanity has ever witnessed.</p> <p>Only the Messenger can stand against them, the A.I. tells its new pilot. Only you can do what must be done.</p>";
