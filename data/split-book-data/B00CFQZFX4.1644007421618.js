It is narrated as a book, rather than with chapter and verse numbers as in the print edition. This will give you the greatest enjoyment as you listen to the words of the prophets and learn about faith. </p> <p><i>The Lectures on Faith</i> were originally prepared as materials for the School of the Prophets in Kirtland, Ohio in 1834 and were included in the Doctrine and Covenants from 1835 to 1921. </p>";
