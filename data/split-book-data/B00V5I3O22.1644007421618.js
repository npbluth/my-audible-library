Among them is Dr. Cassandra Jane \"CJ\" Cameron, a writer for <i>National Geographic</i>, and an expert on reptiles. The visitors are assured by their Chinese hosts that they will be struck with wonder at these beasts, that the dragons are perfectly safe, and that nothing can go wrong. Of course it can't.... </p>";
