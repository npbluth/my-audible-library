window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Travis Macy has summited glacial peaks in the French Alps, rappelled into limestone caves in China, and raced through parched deserts in Utah. In 2013 he famously won the Leadman Series, a combination of nearly 300 miles of high-altitude trail running and mountain biking over the course of five epic endurance races. Macy achieved all of these victories without elite professional training or even exceptional strength, speed, or flexibility. His secret? A precise outlook he calls the \"ultra mindset\", a set of simple principles for daily life that includes embracing fear, rewriting the stories we tell ourselves, and mastering the art of asking for help. </p> <p>By practicing these principles in all areas of life, anyone can successfully achieve goals that might have otherwise seemed impossible. </p>";
