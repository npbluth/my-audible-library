If so, Rachel Hollis has something to tell you: that’s a lie.</p> <p>If you have ever said any of these things to yourself...something else will make me happy; I’m not a good mom; I will never get past this; I am defined by my weight; I should be further along by now...then you could benefit from the unflinching faith and rock-hard tenacity Rachel Hollis has in store for you.
