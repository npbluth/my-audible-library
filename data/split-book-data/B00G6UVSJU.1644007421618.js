window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When society ceases to exist, who can you trust? </p> <p>After the collapse of the nation's power grid, America is under martial law - and safety is an illusion. As violence erupts around him, Morgan Carter faces one of his most difficult decisions yet: whether to stay and defend his home, or move to a more isolated area, away from the prying eyes of the government. He and his family are hesitant to leave their beloved Lake County, but with increasingly suspicious activities happening in a nearby refugee camp, all signs point towards defecting. Morgan and his friends aren't going to leave without a fight, though - and they'll do anything to protect their freedoms. </p> <p>From the author of the hit survivalist novels <i>Going Home </i>and <i>Surviving Home</i>, <i>Escaping Home </i> describes the struggle to live in a world with no rules, and how, sometimes, the strength of family is the only thing that can pull you through. </p>";
