You ain't never heard anything like it! Oh, and itâ€™s now a </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> audio bestseller!</b></p> <p>Bestselling author Mike Sacks (<i>And Here's the Kicker, Poking a Dead Frog</i>) has just discovered the original novelization of the long-lost classic movie, <i>Stinker Lets Loose!</i></p> <p>Mike has teamed up with director Eric Martin to adapt the novelization into a fully immersive cinematic audio experience, and an epic all-star cast has come together to introduce Stinker to a whole new generation of fans! It's <i>Smokey and the Bandit</i> meets <i>Every Which Way But Loose</i> meets <i>Smokey and the Bandit Parts 2 and 3</i>. Feel the thrill as Stinker teams up with old pals Boner and Jumbo, plus new friends Buck and Rascal the Chimp, for a crazy ride across the highways and byways of Bicentennial America and meets scores of beautiful Southern gals, reams of treacherous villains, and even the Big Man!</p> <p>Will Stinker truly Let Loose? Or will Big Government and the Smokeys bring him down?&nbsp;</p> <p>A loving send-up of a bygone era of trucker films and their beer-swillin', skirt-chasin', verb-shortenin' heroes, this audio adventure is a joyride in absurdity; with its rapid-fire jokes only matched by their total outrageousness.
