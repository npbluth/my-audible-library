window.bookSummaryJSON = "By their nature, \"fables\" are \"fabulous\", larger than life, the characters often using wit and guile to save themselves from circumstances. Thus Brer Rabbit is more than a bunny in a briar patch, just as Mowgli is more than a wolf child. <p> Aesop, an ancient Greek poet who was sold into slavery in the early sixth century B.C, relied on animal stories to convey his key points to his masters in court. <i>Aesop's Fables</i> are now classic, memorable morality plays in which amusing animal characters drive home thought-provoking morals to generations of listeners and modern day readers. They illustrate what was fundamental to Greek culture yet their appeal lies in logic we still understand.</p> <p> Fables from different cultures frequently overlap in the lessons they teach. If we would only stop to listen, there is an important lesson for us to learn from these fables; mankind is one, not several. </p>";
