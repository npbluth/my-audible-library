window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"In war, destruction is everywhere. It eats everything around you. Sometimes it eats at you.\" (Major Scott Huesing, Echo Company Commander) </p> <p>From the winter of 2006 through the spring of 2007, 250 marines from Echo Company, Second Battalion, Fourth Marine Regiment, fought daily in the dangerous, dense city streets of Ramadi, Iraq, during the Multi-National Forces Surge ordered by President George W. Bush. The marines' mission: to kill or capture anti-Iraqi forces. Their experience: like being in hell. </p> <p>Now Major Scott A. Huesing, the commander who led Echo Company through Ramadi, takes listeners back to the streets of Ramadi in a visceral, gripping portrayal of modern urban combat. Bound together by brotherhood, honor, and the horror they faced, Echo's marines battled day to day on the frontline of a totally different kind of war, without rules, built on chaos. In <i>Echo in Ramadi</i>, Huesing brings these resilient, resolute young men to life and shows how the savagery of urban combat left indelible scars on their bodies, psyches, and souls. Like war classics <i>We Were Soldiers</i>, <i>The Yellow Birds</i>, and <i>Generation Kill</i>, <i>Echo in Ramadi</i> is an unforgettable capsule of one company's experience of war that will leave listeners stunned. </p>";
