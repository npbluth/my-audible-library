Combining the expertise and insight of a leading journalist and a pioneering designer, <i>User Friendly</i> provides a definitive, thoughtful, and practical perspective on a topic that has rapidly gone from arcane to urgent to inescapable. In <i>User Friendly</i>, Kuang and Fabricant tell the whole story for the first time - and you’ll never interact with technology the same way again.</p>";
