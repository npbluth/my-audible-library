window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In August 1776, a little over a month after the Continental Congress had formally declared independence from Britain, the revolution was on the verge of a sudden and disastrous end. General George Washington found his troops outmanned and outmaneuvered at the Battle of Brooklyn, and it looked like there was no escape. But thanks to a series of desperate rear-guard attacks by a single heroic regiment, famously known as the Immortal 400, Washington was able to evacuate his men, and the nascent Continental Army lived to fight another day. </p> <p>Today, only a modest rusted and scarred metal sign near a dilapidated auto garage marks the mass grave where the bodies of the \"Maryland Heroes\" lie - 256 men \"who fell in the Battle of Brooklyn\". In <i>Washington's Immortals</i>, best-selling military historian Patrick K. O'Donnell brings to life the forgotten story of this remarkable band of brothers. Known as \"gentlemen of honor, family, and fortune\", they fought not just in Brooklyn but also in key battles, including Trenton, Princeton, Camden, Cowpens, Guilford Courthouse, and Yorktown, where their heroism changed the course of the war. </p> <p>Drawing on extensive original sources, from letters to diaries to pension applications, O'Donnell pieces together the stories of these brave men - their friendships, loves, defeats, and triumphs. He explores their arms and tactics, their struggles with hostile loyalists and shortages of clothing and food, their development into an elite unit, and their dogged opponents, including British general Lord Cornwallis. And through the prism of this one group, O'Donnell tells the larger story of the Revolutionary War. </p> <p><i>Washington's Immortals</i> is gripping and inspiring boots-on-the-ground history, sure to appeal to a wide audience. </p>";
