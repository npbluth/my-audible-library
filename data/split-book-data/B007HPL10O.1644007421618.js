Now a man without a country, he wreaks his revenge upon the Spanish Main as a buccaneer. The only thing that saves him from absolute dissolution is the love he still harbors for Miss Arabella Bishop. Now, he is forced to balance the dictates of his conscience with his natural genius for piracy.</p>";
