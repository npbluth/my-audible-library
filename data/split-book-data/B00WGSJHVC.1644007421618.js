window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>On June 13, 1966, men of the 1st Recon Battalion, 1st Marine Division, were stationed on Hill 488. Before the week was over, they would fight the battle that would make them the most highly decorated small unit in the entire history of the US military, winning a Congressional Medal of Honor, four Navy Crosses, 13 Silver Stars, and 18 Purple Hearts - some of them posthumously. </p> <p>During the early evening of June 15, a battalion of hardened North Vietnamese regulars and Viet Cong - outnumbering the Americans 25 to one - threw everything they had at the 16 marines and two navy corpsmen for the rest of that terror-filled night. Every man who held the hill was either killed or wounded defending the ground with unbelievable courage and unflagging determination - even as reinforcements were on the way. All they had to do was make it until dawn.... </p>";
