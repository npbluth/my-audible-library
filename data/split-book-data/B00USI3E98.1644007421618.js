window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A stunning serial-killer novel from David Levien, featuring his acclaimed and indomitable investigator, Frank Behr.... This is the bigger thriller we've been wanting from Levien. </p> <p>A young woman's body is found on a side street in Indianapolis, horrifyingly arranged. Meanwhile Frank Behr, who is down on his luck and virtually broke, takes on a no-win case to locate a single mother's wayward daughter who's been missing for months. Suddenly Behr feels the two cases may be connected, but he is years removed from his life as a legitimate police officer and has few friends left on the force. His relentless focus has always been his greatest strength...and his deepest flaw. </p> <p>As the death toll rises, it becomes clear Indianapolis has a serial killer in its midst...an invisible average Joe who passes beneath the radar but commits unspeakable acts. Frank Behr's pursuit will lead him to a dark place - and ultimately to a devastating decision from which he will not be able to turn back. </p> <p><i>Signature Kill</i> is David Levien's most masterful novel yet - an audiobook that will attract attention from a wider group of thriller fans. </p>";
