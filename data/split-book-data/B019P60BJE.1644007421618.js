window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A Powerful Novelization from Best-Selling Author Angela Hunt </p> <p>Epic in scope yet deeply personal, this novelization offers a unique perspective on the story of the resurrection. </p> <p>Roman Tribune Clavius is assigned by Pilate to keep the radical followers of the recently executed Yeshua from stealing the body and inciting revolution. When the body goes missing despite his precautions, Clavius must hunt it down. His investigation leads him from the halls of Herod Antipas to the Garden of Gethsemane and brings him in touch with believer and doubter alike. But as the body still remains missing, Clavius commits to a quest for the truth - and answers that will not only shake his life but echo throughout all of history. </p>";
