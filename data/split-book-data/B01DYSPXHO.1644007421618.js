window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>One of the best-selling books of all time, with over 100 million copies sold in 44 different languages. The novel was extraordinarily popular upon its release and has never been out of print. </p> <p>Follow the journey of Horace Holly and his ward, Leo Vincey, to a lost kingdom in the African interior. There they encounter a primitive race of natives and a mysterious white queen named Ayesha who reigns as the all-powerful \"She\", or \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\". In this work, Rider Haggard developed the conventions of the Lost World subgenre, which many later authors emulated. </p> <p>This is the blueprint for the Indiana Jones series. </p>";
