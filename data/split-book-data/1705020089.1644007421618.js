window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>From an acclaimed master of historical fiction comes an epic saga about a reluctant hero, the Roman Empire, and the rise of a new power.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>Jerusalem and the Sinai desert, AD 55. In the turbulent aftermath of the crucifixion of Jesus, agents of the Roman Empire receive information about a pilgrim bearing an incendiary letter from a religious fanatic calling himself Paul the Apostle to insurrectionists in Corinth. What's in the letter could bring down an empire.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Romans hire a former legionary, a solitary man-at-arms named Telamon to intercept the letter and destroy the courier. Telamon fights for money, not principles. He's been promised a rich reward; should he fail, the punishment is death by crucifixion. But once he meets the courier, Telamon experiences an extraordinary conversion, and instead of carrying out the mission, takes on the Empire.&nbsp;</p> <p>In his first novel of the ancient world in 13 years, the best-selling author of <i>Gates of Fire</i> and <i>Tides of War </i>returns with a gripping saga of conquest and rebellion, bloodshed and faith.</p>";
