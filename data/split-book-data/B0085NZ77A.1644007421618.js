window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The First World War is one of history’s greatest tragedies. In this remarkable and intimate account, author G. J. Meyer draws on exhaustive research to bring to life the story of how the Great War reduced Europe’s mightiest empires to rubble, killed 20 million people, and cracked the foundations of the world we live in today. </p> <p>World War I is unique in the number of questions about it that remain unsettled. After more than 90 years, scholars remain divided on these questions, and it seems likely that they always will. <i>A World Undone</i> does not claim to have all the answers - if answers are even possible. However, it will provide listeners with enough information to understand why the questions persist, and perhaps in some cases, to arrive at conclusions of their own. <i>A World Undone</i> is a grand, tragic story brilliantly told. </p> <p>About the author: G. J. Meyer is a professional writer whose work has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>Boston Globe</i>, <i>Harper’s</i>, and many other publications. While working for the <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>, he was awarded a Nieman Fellowship by Harvard University. He is the author of the <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>The Tudors</i>, the Edgar Award-winning <i>The Memphis Murders</i>, and other works.</p>";
