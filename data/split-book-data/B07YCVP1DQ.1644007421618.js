window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A family must come to terms with the past when two missing children reappear after 40 years. As the secrets unravel in this real-life tale, can the family lay to rest the ghosts of the past? Growing up in a poor Yiddish-speaking home in 1950s London, teenager Lillian marries a charming older man, Raymond. One day he takes their children to the local park. They never come back. Forty years later, they reappear—and the search for the truth begins.</p> <p>Unfolding like a mystery novel, the series follows an eccentric Jewish family as they unearth family secrets, attempt to reconcile, and hear shocking news that sheds a new light on events. Creator Danny Ben-Moshe is an award-winning documentary filmmaker. This Audible Original expands and continues the story from his acclaimed documentary, <i>My Mother’s Lost Children,</i> which was reviewed as \"heartfelt and unflinching\" by <i>The Times</i> of London, \"critics choice\" in <i>The Sunday Times,</i> and “exemplary work” by the <i>New Statesman.</i></p> <p>Danny sets out to find the truth but comes to the conclusion that the truth can be elusive. It seems that every family has a story…and a secret. This engaging tale is told by a dynamic cast, and as the story unravels, the plot thickens. While dealing with serious issues, the story is also full of wit, quirkiness, and laughter. <br> &nbsp;</p>";
