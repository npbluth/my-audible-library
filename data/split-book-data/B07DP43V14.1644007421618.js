window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> best seller</b></p> <p><b>An inspiring personal story of redemption, second chances, and the transformative power within us all, from the founder and CEO of the nonprofit </b><b><i>charity: water</i></b><b>.</b>&nbsp;</p> <p>At 28 years old, Scott Harrison had it all. A top nightclub promoter in New York City, his life was an endless cycle of drugs, booze, models - repeat. But 10 years in, desperately unhappy and morally bankrupt, he asked himself, \"What would the exact opposite of my life look like?\" Walking away from everything, Harrison spent the next 16 months on a hospital ship in West Africa and discovered his true calling. In 2006, with no money and less than no experience, Harrison founded <b>charity: water</b>. Today, his organization has raised more than $400 million to bring clean drinking water to more than 10 million people around the&nbsp;globe.&nbsp;</p> <p>In&nbsp;<i>Thirst</i>, Harrison recounts the twists and turns that built charity:&nbsp;water into one of the most trusted and admired nonprofits in the world. Renowned for its 100 percent donation model, bold storytelling, imaginative branding, and radical commitment to transparency, charity:&nbsp;water has disrupted how social entrepreneurs work while inspiring millions of people to join its mission of bringing clean water to everyone on the planet within our&nbsp;lifetime.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the tradition of such best-selling books as <i>Shoe Dog</i>&nbsp;and <i>Mountains Beyond Mountains</i>, <i>Thirst</i>&nbsp;is a riveting account of how to build a better charity, a better business, a better life - and a gritty tale that proves it’s never too late to make a&nbsp;change.&nbsp;</p> <p>The author will donate 100 percent of his net proceeds from<i> Thirst</i> to fund <b>charity: water</b> projects around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
