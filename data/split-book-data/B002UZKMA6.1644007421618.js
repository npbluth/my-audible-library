window.bookSummaryJSON = "Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and veteran author William R. Forstchen combine their talents in this powerful and rousing alternate history of the most legendary Civil War clash. <p> After two days of brutal combat, Confederate General Robert E. Lee is faced with an agonizing decision. He can either launch a frontal assault directly at the center of Union lines, or he can flank the Federals and attack from the rear. Choosing the second option, Lee sends his troops around the Union army, cutting them off from Washington, D.C. and their supplies. Staring at the face of disaster, the Federals are forced into a desperate fight to survive.</p> <p> <i>Gettysbury</i> is a fascinating \"what if?\" novel that faithfully brings to life the major players in America's greatest battle and places them in an entirely plausible scenario. Through Tom Stechschulte's stirring narration, listeners will marvel at what could have been. </p>";
