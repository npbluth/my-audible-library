window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Over the past two decades, Antony Beevor has established himself as one of the world's premier historians of World War II. His multi-award winning books have included <i>Stalingrad</i> and <i>The Fall of Berlin 1945</i>. Now, in his newest and most ambitious book, he turns his focus to one of the bloodiest and most tragic events of the 20th century, <i>The Second World War</i>. </p> <p>In this searing narrative, which takes us from Hitler's invasion of Poland on September 1st, 1939 to V-J day on August 14th, 1945, and the war's aftermath, Beevor describes the conflict and its global reach - one that included every major power. The result is a dramatic and breathtaking single-volume history that provides a remarkably intimate account of the war that, more than any other, still commands attention and an audience. </p> <p>Thrillingly written and brilliantly researched, Beevor's grand and provocative account is destined to become the definitive work on this complex, tragic, and endlessly fascinating period in world history. It confirms once more that he is a military historian of the first rank.</p>";
