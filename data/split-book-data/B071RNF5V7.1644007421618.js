window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Pediatrician and best-selling author Meg Meeker has a message: stop undervaluing fatherhood. </p> <p>We live in a culture that hails motherhood as a woman's crowning achievement yet defines men first and foremost by their professional accomplishments, treating fatherhood as almost incidental - a bonus. But from her years spent as a pediatrician listening to children's needs and fears, Dr. Meeker understands just how crucial a father's role is. </p> <p><i>Hero</i> is a powerful affirmation of fatherhood that shows men how being a strong, active father can be their greatest triumph. </p>";
