window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The author of the legendary best seller <i>Influence</i>, social psychologist Robert Cialdini, shines a light on effective persuasion and reveals that the secret doesn't lie in the message itself but in the key moment before that message is delivered. </p> <p>What separates effective communicators from truly successful persuaders? Using the same combination of rigorous scientific research and accessibility that made his <i>Influence</i> an iconic best seller, Robert Cialdini explains how to capitalize on the essential window of time before you deliver an important message. This \"privileged moment for change\" prepares people to be receptive to a message before they experience it. Optimal persuasion is achieved only through optimal <i>pre</i>-suasion. In other words, to change <i>minds</i>, a pre-suader must also change <i>states of mind</i>. </p> <p>His first solo work in over 30 years, Cialdini's <i>Pre-Suasion</i> draws on his extensive experience as the most cited social psychologist of our time and explains the techniques a person should implement to become a master persuader. Altering a listener's attitudes, beliefs, or experiences isn't necessary, says Cialdini - all that's required is for a communicator to redirect the audience's focus of attention before a relevant action. </p> <p>From studies on advertising imagery to treating opiate addiction, from the annual letters of Berkshire Hathaway to the annals of history, Cialdini draws on an array of studies and narratives to outline the specific techniques you can use on online marketing campaigns and even effective wartime propaganda. He illustrates how the artful diversion of attention leads to successful pre-suasion and gets your targeted audience primed and ready to say yes. </p>";
