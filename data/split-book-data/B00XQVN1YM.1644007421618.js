window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It was hell's season, and the air smelled of burning children.... With \"one of the most arresting first sentences in contemporary writing\" (<i>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>), Robert McCammon unfurls his visionary masterpiece of survival, redemption, and the astonishing transformations love can create. <i>Gone South</i> chronicles a desperate man's journey through a desperate land, in \"a gothic picaresque that mixes gritty plot and black comedy...a smoothly constructed and satisfying story\" (<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>). Flooded by memories, poisoned by Agent Orange, Dan Lambert kills a man in a moment of fear and fury - and changes his life forever. </p> <p>Pursued by police and bounty hunters, Dan flees south toward the Louisiana bayous. In the swamplands he meets Arden Halliday, a young woman who bears the vivid burdens of her own past and who is searching for a legendary faith healer called the Bright Girl. Looking for simple kindness in a world that rarely shows it, bound by a loyalty stronger than love, Dan and Arden set off on a journey of relentless suspense and impassioned discovery...over dark, twisting waterways into the mysterious depths of the human heart. </p>";
