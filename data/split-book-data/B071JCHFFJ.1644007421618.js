window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Former Army Ranger Kris Paronto, a survivor of the 2012 Benghazi siege that was subject of the book and movie <i>13 Hours</i>, provides powerful motivational tools for surviving and thriving to bring discipline, motivation, success, and peace to listeners' lives.</b> </p> <p>Thousands of people have heard Kris \"Tanto\" Paronto speak about his experiences in Benghazi on September 11, 2012. But before he was a security contractor, Tanto was a US Army Ranger from Second Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment. Rangers are trained to lead by being pushed to their physical and mental limits so that they can perform against impossible odds in punishing situations. In <i>The Ranger Way</i>, Tanto shares stories from his training experiences that played a role in his team's heroic response in Benghazi. Being a Ranger is, by design, not for everyone, but anyone can use the expectations and techniques of Ranger culture to achieve personal victory. </p> <p>In <i>The Ranger Way</i>, Tanto explains the importance of demanding excellence when you commit to improving your life. He shows you how to define your mission, set goals that are in alignment with your values, and develop a battle plan that will maximize your chances of success. You will learn why you should never quit and why that is different from never failing. Tanto uses his experiences in basic and Ranger training to explore how to deal with mistakes and disappointment like a leader, accept responsibility, and turn every obstacle into an opportunity for growth. You will learn why being of service to others and being willing to sacrifice will help you succeed and how the power of humility, strength, faith, and brotherhood will sustain you on the road to accomplishing your mission. </p>";
