window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Spur-Award winning author Elmer Kelton delivers the sequel to his novel <i>Slaughter </i>with this powerful story of one man's search for peace on the war-stricken plains of the Wild West.&nbsp;</p> <p>In <i>The Far Canyon</i>, Kelton masterfully unveils for his listener the finality of the buffaloâ€™s demise, the beginning of a time when cattle would replace the American bison on the Southern plains and ultimately end the Plains Indian culture. The novel reveals the history of the period, not in a general grand swoop of the pen, but rather, up close and personal, so his listeners can judge the impact of the period upon his characters.</p>";
