window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>American journalist, short story writer, and poet, Ambrose Bierce is best known for his formidably vicious wit - given free rein in his famous column, \"The Prattler.\" But his stories were elegantly crafted, with a compelling blend of realistic detail, clever plot twists, and his own sardonic humor. These 8 macabre stories, read here by Mark Hammer, establish Bierce as a master of the genre. Included are \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,\" \"The Damned Thing,\" \"A Watcher by the Dead,\" \"An Inhabitant of Carcosa,\" \"The Famous Gilson Bequest,\" \"The Eyes of the Panther,\" \"The Secret of Macarger's Gulch,\" and \"The Night-Doings at 'Deadman's'.\"</p>";
