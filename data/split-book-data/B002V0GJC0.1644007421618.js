window.bookSummaryJSON = "Get ready for a rousing rebel yell as best-selling author H. W. Crocker III charges through bunkers and battlefields in <i>The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War</i>. Crocker busts myths and shatters stereotypes as he profiles eminent and colorful military generals, revealing little-known truths, like why Robert E. Lee had a higher regard for African-Americans than Lincoln did. Crocker culminates his tome in the most politically incorrect chapter of all: \"What If the South Had Won.\" This is the \"P.I.\" Guide that every Civil War buff and Southern partisan will want on their bookshelf, in their classroom, and under their Christmas tree.";
