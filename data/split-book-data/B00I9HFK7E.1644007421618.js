window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An insightful guide that shows how habits of behavior are formed, and how we can transform bad habits into positive behaviors in ourselves and others. <i>Smart Change</i> explores the psychological mechanisms that form and maintain habits in individuals and groups and offers real, accessible and actionable advice for changing habits. In an engaging narrative, Markman covers a wide range of habits, from individual behaviors like eating better and exercising regularly to work-related behaviors such as learning effectively and influencing customers’ purchases. </p> <p>He proposes that there are five effective tools to help individuals change behavior and to help people influence the habits of the people around them:</p> <p>1. Tame the “Go” system: Identify the triggers of habits, replace old behaviors with new ones and generate specific plans to deal with obstacles.</p> <p>2. Harness the “Stop” system: Learn to deal with stress and other factors that hinder the development of new and positive habits.</p> <p>3. Optimize your goals. Determine the course of behavior change and how to successfully incorporate those changes for the long term.</p> <p>4. Manage your environment: Change your surroundings to dramatically reduce poor behavior and habits.</p> <p>5. Engage your Neighbors: To affect other people’s behavior, understand the shared culture that creates a mutual dependency, and allows neighbors and colleagues to have a profound positive influence on the behavior of other members of their community. </p>";
