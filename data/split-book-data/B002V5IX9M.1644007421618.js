window.bookSummaryJSON = "God did not mean for salvation to be a deep, complicated subject that man could not understand. But sometimes man's words confuse God's simple truths. D. L. Moody, one of the 19th century's greatest evangelists, shows how simple salvation is. Avoiding heavy philosophy, he simply shows \"the way to God.\" <p><i>The Way to God</i> is filled with stories about ordinary people. Anyone willing to have honest questions and doubts answered will appreciate such topics as, \"Who is Christ?\" \"How can I know my sins have been forgiven?\" and \"What can I do if I have turned away from God?\"</p> <p>More than one million copies of this classic work have been distributed since it was first published in 1894.</p>";
