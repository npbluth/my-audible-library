window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Upton Sinclair's <i>The Jungle</i> is a visceral and tragic story of immigrants trying to scratch out a living in the meatpacking plants of Chicago. The resulting public outcry led directly to the US government enacting changes in food and workplace safety practices still in place today.</p><p>With food production, business ethics, and immigration back in the news, Academy Award nominee Casey Affleck (<i>Gone Baby Gone</i>) taps into the emotion behind these issues to breathe life back into the struggling inhabitants of Packingtown. Affleck, a committed vegan and animal rights spokesman, delivers a moving performance that connects with the bookâ€™s enduring legacy.</p><p><i>The Jungle</i> revolves around the life and family of Jurgis Rudkus, a Lithuanian immigrant whose dreams of a better life are crushed by punishing work in gruesome stockyards and an unforgiving city. Brilliantly written and vividly described, it provides a poignant and incredibly detailed snapshot of a striking point in American history.</p>";
