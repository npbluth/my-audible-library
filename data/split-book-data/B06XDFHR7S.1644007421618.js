window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A timely collection of speeches by David McCullough, the most honored historian in the United States - winner of two Pulitzer Prizes, two National Book Awards, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, among many others - that reminds us of fundamental American principles. </p> <p>Over the course of his distinguished career, David McCullough has spoken before Congress, colleges and universities, historical societies, and other esteemed institutions. Now, at a time of self-reflection in America following a bitter election campaign that has left the country divided, McCullough has collected some of his most important speeches in a brief volume designed to identify important principles and characteristics that are particularly American. <i>The American Spirit</i> reminds us of core American values to which we all subscribe, regardless of which region we live in, which political party we identify with, or our ethnic background. This is a book about America for all Americans that reminds us who we are and helps to guide us as we find our way forward. </p>";
