window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>For fans of <i>A Man Called Ove</i> comes a funny, big-hearted tale about an old man who is young at heart.</b> </p> <p>Hendrik Groen may be old, but he is far from dead and isn't planning to be buried any time soon. Granted, his daily strolls are getting shorter because his legs are no longer willing, and he has to visit his doctor more than he'd like. Technically speaking he is...elderly. But surely there is more to life at his age than weak tea and potted geraniums? </p> <p>Hendrik sets out to write an expos√©: a year in the life of his care home in Amsterdam, revealing all its ups and downs - not least his new endeavor, the anarchic Old-but-Not-Dead Club. And when Eefje moves in - the woman Hendrik has always longed for - he polishes his shoes (and his teeth), grooms what's left of his hair, and attempts to make something of the life he has left, with hilarious, tender, and devastating consequences. </p> <p><i>The Secret Diary of Hendrik Groen</i> will not only delight older listeners with its wit and relevance but charm and inspire those who have years to go before their own expiry dates. </p>";
