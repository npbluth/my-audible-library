window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Because it’s a novel, the truth can be told. Because it’s the truth, you’ll never forget it.... </p> <p>Gene Wentz's <i>Men in Green Faces</i> is the classic novel of Vietnam that inspired a generation of SEALs. Here is the story of a good soldier trained to be part of an elite team of warriors - and of the killing grounds where he was forever changed. </p> <p>Gene Michaels carries an M-60, 800 rounds, and a Bible. The ultimate SEAL, he also carries a murderous grudge against a bloodthirsty colonel who was once one of their own. To bring him in, Michaels and his men will go behind the lines, where they’ll take on 5,000 NVA in the fight of their lives. In this stunning novel, former SEAL Gene Wentz brings to life what it was like to be a SEAL in Vietnam, running an endless tour of top-secret, death-defying operations deep in enemy territory. From the camaraderie to the harrowing recons, from brutal interrogations to incredible, toe-to-toe firefights, here are America’s most feared warriors as you’ve never seen them before.</p>";
