window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i></b><b> meets </b><b><i>Sky in the Deep</i></b><b> in this bewitching historical horror novel, perfect for fans of Holly Black and V.E. Schwab. </b></p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Aderyn (\"Ryn\") only cares about two things: her family and her family's graveyard. And right now, both are in dire straits. Since the death of their parents, Ryn and her siblings have been scraping together a meager existence as gravediggers in the remote village of Colbren, which sits at the foot of a harsh and deadly mountain range that was once home to the fae. The problem with being a gravedigger in Colbren, though, is that the dead don't always <i>stay</i> dead.</p> <p>The risen corpses are known as \"bone houses\", and legend says that they're the result of a decades-old curse. When Ellis, an apprentice mapmaker with a mysterious past, arrives in town, the bone houses attack with new ferocity. What is it that draws them near? And more importantly, how can they be stopped for good?</p> <p>Together, Ellis and Ryn embark on a journey that will take them into the heart of the mountains, where they will have to face both the curse and the deeply-buried truths about themselves. Equal parts classic horror novel and original fairy tale, <i>The Bone Houses </i>will have you spellbound from the very first minute.</p> <p>An instant IndieBound best seller!&nbsp;</p>";
