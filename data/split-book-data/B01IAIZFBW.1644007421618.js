window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;best-selling author Shauna Niequist invites you to look at the landscape of your own life, consider what it might look like to leave behind the pressure to be perfect, and begin the life-changing practice of simply being present in the middle of the mess and the ordinariness of life.</p> <p>A few years ago, Shauna found herself exhausted and isolated, her soul and body sick. She was tired of being tired and burned out on busy. It seemed like almost everyone she talked to was in the same boat: Longing for connection, meaning, and depth, but settling for busy.</p> <p>But then something changed: She learned a new way to live. She decided to trade the hustle and bustle for grace, love, stillness, and play, and it changed everything. Shauna offers an honest account of what led her to begin this journey and a compelling vision for an entirely new way to live: Soaked in rest, silence, simplicity, prayer, and connection with the people who matter most to us.</p> <p>As you witness Shauna's journey, you'll be inspired to embark on one of your own. She gives you the encouragement you need to:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Put an end to people-pleasing tendencies</li> <li>Embrace moments of simplicity, quiet, and stillness</li> <li>Accept that you are worthy of love, belonging, and joy</li> </ul> <p>Written in Shauna's warm and vulnerable style, this collection of essays focuses on the most important transformation in her life, and maybe yours too: Leaving behind busyness and frantic living and rediscovering the person you were made to be.&nbsp;<i>Present Over Perfect</i>&nbsp;is a hand reaching out, pulling you free from the constant pressure to perform faster, push harder, and produce more while maintaining an exhausting image of perfection.</p> <p>Join the over 500,000 others who have already started walking this new path away from frantic pushing and proving and toward their true selves.</p>";
