window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“This will be a fight against overwhelming odds from which survival cannot be expected. We will do what damage we can.” </b></p> <p>With these words, Lieutenant Commander Robert W. Copeland addressed the crew of the destroyer escort USS <i>Samuel B. Roberts</i> on the morning of October 25, 1944, off the Philippine Island of Samar. On the horizon loomed the mightiest ships of the Japanese navy, a massive fleet that represented the last hope of a staggering empire. All that stood between it and Douglas MacArthur’ s vulnerable invasion force were the <i>Roberts </i>and the other small ships of a tiny American flotilla poised to charge into history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>In the tradition of the number-one <i>New York Times</i> best seller <i>Flags of Our Fathers</i>, James D. Hornfischer paints an unprecedented portrait of the Battle of Samar, a naval engagement unlike any other in US history - and captures with unforgettable intensity the men, the strategies, and the sacrifices that turned certain defeat into a legendary victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>Praise for </b><b><i>The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors </i></b></p> <p>“One of the finest WWII naval action narratives in recent years, this book follows in the footsteps of <i>Flags of Our Fathers</i>.... Exalting American sailors and pilots as they richly deserve.... Reads like a very good action novel.” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)</p> <p>“Reads as fresh as tomorrow's headlines.... Hornfischer's captivating narrative uses previously classified documents to reconstruct the epic battle and eyewitness accounts to bring the officers and sailors to life.” (<i>Texas Monthly</i>)</p> <p>“Hornfischer is a powerful stylist whose explanations are clear as well as memorable.... A dire survival-at-sea saga.” (<i>Denver Post</i>)</p> <p>“In <i>The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors</i>, James Hornfischer drops you right into the middle of this raging battle, with 5-inch guns blazing, torpedoes detonating and Navy fliers dive-bombing.... The overall story of the battle is one of American guts, glory and heroic sacrifice.” (<i>Omaha World Herald</i>)</p>";
