window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This is the story of Michael Talbot, his family, and his friends: a band of ordinary people trying to get by in extraordinary times. When disaster strikes, Mike, a self-proclaimed survivalist, does his best to ensure the safety and security of those he cares for. Book One of the Zombie Fallout Trilogy follows our lead character at his self-deprecating, sarcastic best. What he encounters along the way leads him down a long dark road, always skirting the edge of insanity.&nbsp;</p> <p>Can he keep his family safe? Can he discover the secret behind Tommy's powers? Can he save anyone from the zombie queen? Encircled in a seemingly safe haven called Little Turtle, Mike and his family, together with the remnants of a tattered community, must fight against a relentless, ruthless, unstoppable force. This last bastion of civilization has made its final stand. God help them all.&nbsp;</p> <p><b>This is a new and updated edition of the previously published title, which originally released on Audible in 2012. This new production features the author's most updated language and revisions, aligning with the most recent edition of the eBook.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>";
