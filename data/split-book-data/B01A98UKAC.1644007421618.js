window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An inventive debut in the tradition of <i>World War Z</i> and <i>The Martian</i>, told in interviews, journal entries, transcripts, and news articles, <i>Sleeping Giants</i> is a literary thriller fueled by a quest for truth - and a fight for control of earthshaking power. </p> <p>A girl named Rose is riding her new bike near her home in Deadwood, South Dakota, when she falls through the earth. She wakes up at the bottom of a square hole, its walls glowing with intricate carvings. But the firemen who come to save her peer down upon something even stranger: a little girl in the palm of a giant metal hand. </p> <p>Seventeen years later, the mystery of the bizarre artifact remains unsolved - its origins, architects, and purpose unknown. Its carbon dating defies belief; military reports are redacted; theories are floated, then rejected. </p> <p>But some can never stop searching for answers. </p> <p>Rose Franklin is now a highly trained physicist leading a top-secret team to crack the hand's code. And along with her colleagues, she is being interviewed by a nameless interrogator whose power and purview are as enigmatic as the provenance of relic. What's clear is that Rose and her compatriots are on the edge of unraveling history's most perplexing discovery - and figuring out what it portends for humanity. But once the pieces of the puzzle are in place, will the result prove to be an instrument of lasting peace or a weapon of mass destruction? </p>";
