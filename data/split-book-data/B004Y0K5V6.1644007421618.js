window.bookSummaryJSON = "“One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug.” <p></p> <p>With this&nbsp;startling, bizarre, yet surprisingly funny first&nbsp;sentence, Kafka begins his masterpiece, <i>The&nbsp;Metamorphosis</i>. It is the story of a&nbsp;young traveling salesman who, transformed overnight into a giant,&nbsp;beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to&nbsp;his family, an outsider in his own home, a&nbsp;quintessentially alienated man. Rather than being surprised at the transformation, the members of his family despise it as an impending burden upon themselves. </p> <p>A harrowing - though&nbsp;absurdly comic - meditation on human feelings of&nbsp;inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, <i>The&nbsp;Metamorphosis</i> has taken its place as one&nbsp;of the most widely read and influential works of&nbsp;20th-century fiction. As W. H. Auden wrote,&nbsp;“Kafka is important to us because his predicament&nbsp;is the predicament of modern man.”</p> <p>FRANZ KAFKA (1883–1924), one of the major fiction writers of the twentieth century, was born to a middle-class German-speaking Jewish family in Prague. His unique body of writing, much of which is incomplete and was mainly published posthumously, is considered by some people to be among the most influential in Western literature, inspiring such writers as Albert Camus, Rex Warner, and Samuel Beckett.</p>";
