Jones and Ivy and Bean will love this new story about the spunky little rascal with big ideas. </p> <p>The star of <i>Dory Fantasmagory</i> is heading to school. Her older siblings, Luke and Violet, warn her to leave her imaginary friend, Mary, at home - or, better yet, leave her whole imagination at home! Dory is determined to behave like a \"regular old girl who never gets in trouble\", but on her very first day she meets a new friend, a girl whose imagination and style are just about as wild as her own. Now she just has to convince her siblings that she's not making it all up! </p>";
