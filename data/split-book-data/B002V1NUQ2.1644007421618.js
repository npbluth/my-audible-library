window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\" is one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It is the second of the 12 <i>Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i> in most British editions of the canon and the second of the eight stories from <i>His Last Bow</i> in most American versions. When <i>Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i> was published in the United States for the first time, the publishers believed \"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\" was too scandalous for the American public, since it dealt with adultery. As a result, this story was not published in the U.S. until many years later, when it was added to <i>His Last Bow</i>.</p>";
