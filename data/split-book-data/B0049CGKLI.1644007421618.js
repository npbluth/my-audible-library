window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Candide</i>, published simultaneously in five European capitals in 1759, became an instant best seller and is now regarded as one of the key texts of the Enlightenment. Voltaireâ€™s preoccupations with evil and with various kinds of human folly and intolerance found a perfect vehicle in the philosophical tale.
