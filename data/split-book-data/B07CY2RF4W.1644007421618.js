window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The never-before-told story of one of the most decorated units in the war in Afghanistan and its 15-month ordeal that culminated in the 2008 Battle of Wanat, the war's deadliest </b></p> <p>A single company of US paratroopers - calling themselves the \"Chosen Few\" - arrived in eastern Afghanistan in late 2007 hoping to win the hearts and minds of the remote mountain people and extend the Afghan government's reach into this wilderness.&nbsp;</p> <p>Instead, they spent the next 15 months in a desperate struggle, living under almost continuous attack, forced into a slow and grinding withdrawal, and always outnumbered by Taliban fighters descending on them from all sides. Month after month, rocket-propelled grenades, rockets, and machine-gun fire poured down on the isolated and exposed paratroopers as America's focus and military resources shifted to Iraq.&nbsp;</p> <p>Just weeks before the paratroopers were to go home, they faced their last - and toughest - fight. Near the village of Wanat in Nuristan province, an estimated 300 enemy fighters surrounded about 50 of the Chosen Few and others defending a partially finished combat base. Nine died and more than two dozen were wounded that day in July 2008, making it arguably the bloodiest battle of the war in Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Chosen Few </i>would return home tempered by war. Two among them would receive the Medal of Honor. All of them would be forever changed.&nbsp;</p>";
