window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Why do people dodge responsibility when things fall apart? Why the parade of public figures unable to own up when they screw up?

Backed by years of research and delivered in lively, energetic prose, <i>Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)</i> offers a fascinating explanation of self-deception - how it works, the harm it can cause, and how we can overcome it.</p>";
