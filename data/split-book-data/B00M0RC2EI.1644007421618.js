window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The bestselling author of <i>Undoing Depression</i> offers a brain-based guide to help us finally get rid of the bad habits that plague us. </p> <p>We humans tend to get in our own way time and time again - whether it comes to not speaking up for ourselves, going back to bad romantic partners, our umpteenth diet, or engaging in any of a range of bad habits we just can’t seem to shake. In <i>Rewire</i>, renowned psychotherapist Richard O’Connor, PhD, reveals why our bad habits die so hard. We have two brains - one a thoughtful, conscious, deliberative self, and the other an automatic self that does most of the work without our attention. Using new research and knowledge about how the brain works, the audiobook clears a path to lasting, effective change for behaviors that include:</p> <ul> <li> procrastination</li> <li>overeating</li> <li>chronic disorganization</li> <li>staying in bad situations</li> <li>excessive worrying</li> <li>risk-taking</li> <li>passive aggression</li> <li>self-medication</li> <li>and more</li> </ul> <p>Bringing together many different fields in psychology and brain science, <i>Rewire</i> offers a refreshing, science-based new paradigm for readers of Charles Duhigg and Frank Lawlis.</p>";
