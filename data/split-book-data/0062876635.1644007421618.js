He carried a light backpack and machete. Before he left, he emailed his father: <i>\"I am not sure how long it will take me, but I’m planning on doing 4 days in the jungle and a day to walk out. I’ll be bounded by a trail to the west and the coast everywhere else, so it should be difficult to get lost forever.\"</i></p> <p>They were the last words Dial received from his son.</p> <p><i>The Adventurer’s Son</i> recreates the author’s two-year quest to learn the truth about his child’s disappearance.

Roman had raised his son to be fearless, to seek out adventure amid earth’s wildest places. Was he ultimately responsible for his son’s fate?</p> <p>A harrowing story of drama, adventure, and a father’s love for his son, set in the most beautiful and dangerous reaches of the planet, <i>The Adventurer’s Son</i> is a mystery, the memoir of a father and his son, and an unforgettable story of love and profound loss.&nbsp;</p>";
