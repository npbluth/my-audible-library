window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Washington Irving paints an effulgent portrait of the New England countryside as Tom Walker walks with the Devil. Would you dare to bargain with the Devil for your soul? </p> <p>This audiobook also includes \"Hurst of Hurstcote\", by E. Nesbit. Here, a young man is so stricken by the passing of his wife that his sanity begins to stray. And, as madness spreads its paralyzing influence over him, he unearths a shocking conclusion.</p>";
