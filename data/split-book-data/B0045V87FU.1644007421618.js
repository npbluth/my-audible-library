window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Selected from sermons delivered by C. S. Lewis during World War II, these nine addresses show the beloved author and theologian bringing hope and courage in a time of great doubt. \"The Weight of Glory\", considered by many to be Lewis’s finest sermon of all, is an incomparable explication of virtue, goodness, desire, and glory. </p> <p>Also included are: “Transposition”, “On Forgiveness”, “Why I Am Not a Pacifist”, and “Learning in War-Time”, in which Lewis presents his compassionate vision of Christianity in language that is both lucid and compelling. </p> <p>Clive Staples (C. S.) Lewis (1898–1963) was one of the intellectual giants of the 20th century and arguably the most influential Christian writer of his day. His major contributions in literary criticism, children’s literature, fantasy literature, and popular theology brought him international renown and acclaim. He wrote more than 30 books, and his works continue to attract thousands of new readers every year. His most distinguished and popular accomplishments include <i>The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, <i>Out of the Silent Planet</i>, <i>The Screwtape Letters</i>, and <i>Mere Christianity</i>.</p>";
