window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In the tradition of&nbsp;<i>Band of Brothers,</i> acclaimed combat historian Patrick K. O’Donnell cinematically tells one of World War II’s greatest untold stories. </p> <p>It is said that the right man in the right place at the right time can mean the difference between victory and defeat. This is the dramatic story of 68 soldiers in the US Army's Second Ranger Battalion, Company D - \"Dog Company\" - who made that difference, time and again.&nbsp;From D-day, when German guns atop Pointe du Hoc threatened the Allied landings and the men of Dog Company scaled the sheer 90-foot cliffs to destroy them; to the slopes of Hill 400, in Germany’s Hürtgen Forest, where the Rangers launched a desperate bayonet charge across an open field; to a \"quiet\" section of the Ardennes, where Dog Company suddenly found itself on the tip of the spear at the Battle of the Bulge; the men of Dog Company made the difference. </p> <p>America had many heroes in World War II; however, few can say that, but for them, the course of the war would have been very different. The right men, the right place, the right time - Dog Company. </p> <p>Patrick K. O’Donnell is the award-winning author of eight books, including the highly acclaimed account of the Battle of Fallujah <i>We Were One.</i> He has provided historical consulting for <i>Band of Brothers</i> and multiple documentaries. He lives in Austin, Texas.</p>";
