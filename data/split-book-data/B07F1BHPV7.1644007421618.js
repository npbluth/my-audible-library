If he can earn a meeting with the ailing king and persuade him to stop Dryden before his dragon flies, he can save Edgewood and countless lives. He'll also get his name posted in every arena, which could lead Rachel one step closer to finding him.</p> <p>The arena is a spectacle where people gather to watch fighters put their skills to the test, earn fame, and take home gold. Does Gunnar have what it takes to become a champion, or has he bitten off more than he can chew?</p>";
