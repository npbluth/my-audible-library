window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>When Helen MacDonald's father died suddenly on a London street, she was devastated. An experienced falconer captivated by hawks since childhood, she'd never before been tempted to train one of the most vicious predators: the goshawk. But in her grief, she saw that the goshawk's fierce and feral anger mirrored her own. Resolving to purchase and raise the deadly creature as a means to cope with her loss, she adopted Mabel and turned to the guidance of <i>The Once and Future King</i> author T. H. White's chronicle <i>The Goshawk</i> to begin her journey into Mabel's world. Projecting herself \"in the hawk's wild mind to tame her\" tested the limits of MacDonald's humanity. </p> <p>By turns heartbreaking and hilarious, this book is an unflinching account of bereavement, a unique look at the magnetism of an extraordinary beast, and the story of an eccentric falconer and legendary writer. Weaving together obsession, madness, memory, myth, and history, <i>H Is for Hawk</i> is a distinctive, surprising blend of nature writing and memoir from a very gifted writer.</p>";
