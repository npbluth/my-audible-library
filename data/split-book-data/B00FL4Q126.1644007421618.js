window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Most of us live with the stubborn idea that we'll always have tomorrow to do our most important and valuable work. We fill our days with frantic activity, bouncing from task to task, scrambling to make deadlines and chase the next promotion. But by the end of each day we're often left asking ourselves \"did the work I do today really matter?\" We feel the ticking of the clock, but we're stuck in first gear, unsure of the path forward and without a road map to guide us. </p> <p>Here's the hard truth: sooner or later all of our tomorrows will run out, so how we choose to spend today is significant. Each day that we postpone difficult tasks and succumb to the clutter that chokes creativity, discipline, and innovation results in a net deficit to the world, our organizations, and ourselves. </p> <p><i>Die Empty</i> is a tool for people who aren't willing to put off their most important work for another day. Todd Henry explains the forces that keep us in stagnation, and introduces a process for instilling consistent practices into your life that will keep you on a true and steady course. It's not about slaving over a project or living on a whim it's about embracing the idea that time is finite and making the unique contribution to the world that only you can make. Henry shows how to cultivate the mindset and the methods you need to sustain your enthusiasm, push through mental barriers, and unleash your best work each day. </p> <p>Sure to bring a newfound clarity and a sense of urgency to how you approach your work every day, <i>Die Empty</i> will help you reach for and achieve your goals. </p>";
