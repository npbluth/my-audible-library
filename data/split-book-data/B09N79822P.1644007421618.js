Sophie Kingston, daughter of an influential East Coast family, was destined to be an important and beloved part of Baltimore Society. Life has not gone quite as either planned.</p> <p>Now, living in the home of a family friend, Sophie joins the lady on a journey to the tiny town of Hope Springs in Wyoming Territory. It is unlike any place she’s ever known. And the resident doctor is a mystery as well. Burke knows he isn’t the success he’d always imagined he would be, and seeing it through the eyes of this newly arrived Society lady only drives that home. As Hope Springs begins to weave its magic, Sophie discovers more than she’d ever imagined, in both the town and its doctor. And Burke, who has always guarded his heart, begins to wonder if there might be more to life than he has previously imagined. Their futures, however, do not lie along the same path or in the same destinations. Fate has once again proven unkind.</p> <p>Can Hope Springs work yet another miracle?</p> <p><b>From the </b><b><i>USA Today</i></b><b> best-selling author of the Hope Springs series, </b><b><i>Choices of the Heart</i></b><b> is set in the beloved world of Hope Springs.</b></p>";
