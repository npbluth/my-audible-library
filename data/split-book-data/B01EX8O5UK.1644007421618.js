window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>After Eric Davis spent over 16 years in the military, including a decade in the SEAL teams, his family was more than used to his absence on deployments and secret missions that could obscure his whereabouts for months at a time. Without a father figure in his own life since the age of 15, Eric was desperate to maintain the bonds he'd fought so hard to forge when his children were young - particularly with his son, Jason, because he knew how difficult it was to face the challenge of becoming a man on one's own. Unfortunately Eric learned the hard way that quality time doesn't always show up in quantity time. </p> <p>Facebook, television, phones, video games, school, jobs, friends - they all got in the way of a real, meaningful father-son relationship. It was time to take action. </p> <p>As a SEAL, Eric learned to innovate and push boundaries, allowing him to function at levels beyond what was expected, comfortable, ordinary, and even imaginable, and he knew that as a father he needed to do the same with his son. Meeting extreme with extreme was the only answer. </p> <p>Using a unique blend of discipline, leadership, adventure, and grace, Eric and his SEAL brothers will teach you how to connect and reconnect with your sons and learn how to raise real men - the Navy SEAL way. </p>";
