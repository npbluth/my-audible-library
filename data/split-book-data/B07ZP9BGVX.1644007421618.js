window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Science fiction allows us to go places we can only dream of seeing - other worlds, distant stars, entirely different galaxies. While not every story is concerned with the hard science behind space travel and other futuristic ventures, fiction can give us amazing insight into what we could be capable of and what we dream of doing.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the 10 lectures of <i>The Science of Sci-Fi: From Warp Speed to Interstellar Travel</i>, Professor Erin Macdonald interweaves real science and the achievements of the imagination to reveal the truth that underlies our favorite stories and sheds light on what the future may hold. From faster-than-light travel to journeys through time itself, science fiction makes humanity seem limitless. So, what scientific boundaries are we pushing against as we seek to fly among the stars?&nbsp;</p> <p>Beginning with an overview of the physics of time and space as we know them, Professor Macdonald shows how stories extrapolate current knowledge to create visions of the future and how likely - or unlikely - these fictional journeys could be. What would happen if a spaceship flew into a wormhole, as it does in the film <i>Galaxy Quest</i>? Or, if you prefer video games, what would happen if you fired a rocket launcher on the Moon like the soldiers of <i>Mass Effect</i>? Could we ever break the bounds of light speed as they do in <i>Star Wars</i> and move across the universe without spending decades trying to make it to a distant exoplanet? Is the transporter technology of <i>Star Trek</i> really possible?&nbsp;</p> <p>As you look closely at artificial gravity, inertial dampeners, tachyons, red matter, time dilation, and other sci-fi mainstays through the theories of some of science’s greatest thinkers, you will find that your favorite science fiction stories become even more astonishing.</p>";
