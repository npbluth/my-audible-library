window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Extreme success, by definition, lies beyond the realm of normal action. If you want to achieve extreme success, you can’t operate like everybody else and settle for mediocrity. You need to remove luck and chance from your business equation, and lock in massive success. <i>The 10X Rule</i> shows you how! Success is your duty, obligation and responsibility, and this audio book gives you step-by-step guidance on how to achieve phenomenal success for yourself! </p> <p>With <i>The 10X Rule</i> , you’ll learn to establish the amount of effort needed to guarantee success and ensure that you can continue operating at this level throughout your life. Most people desire success and have great ideas but they come up short on the amount of action required to get their lives to the exceptional levels they deserve. Four degrees of action exist, and in order to achieve your dreams, you must learn to operate at the fourth degree of action: Massive Action. <i>The 10X Rule</i> will dissolve fear, increase your belief in yourself, eliminate procrastination, and provide you with an overwhelming sense of purpose. <i>The 10X Rule</i> compels you to separate yourself from everyone else in the market—and you do that by doing what others refuse to do. Stop thinking in terms of basic needs, and start aiming for abundance—in all areas of your life. <i>The 10X Rule</i> guides you toward the frame of mind that all successful people share. Aim ten times higher than you are right now—and if you come up short, you’ll still find yourself further along than if you had maintained your life’s current status quo. <i>The 10X Rule</i> teaches you how to:</p> <ul> <li> Reach goals that you previously thought were impossible</li> <li>Correctly set goals and guarantee their achievement</li> <li>Create unprecedented levels of happiness and satisfaction in every area of your life</li> <li>Use fear as fuel to move you into action</li> <li>Get everything you want and never have to settle</li> <li>Dominate your competition and become a role model for success</li> </ul>";
