Each of the four would lose a best friend forever. </b></p> <p>Five months after being deployed to Iraq, Lima Company's 1st Platoon became one of the first American forces to enter Fallujah, where they encountered some of the most intense hand-to-hand combat since World War II. Civilians were used as human shields or as bait to lure soldiers into buildings rigged with explosives; suicide bombers approached from every corner hoping to die and take Americans with them; radical insurgents, high on adrenaline, fought to the death.</p> <p>Award-winning author and historian Patrick O'Donnell stood shoulder to shoulder with Lima Company's 1st Platoon as they fought through the streets of Fallujah, their casualties mounting. This is their story.</p>";
