window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>God Is Disappointed in You</i> is for people who would like to read the Bible...if it would just cut to the chase. Stripped of its arcane language and interminable passages, every book of the Bible is condensed down to its core message, in no more than a few pages each. </p> <p>Written by Mark Russell with cartoons by <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist Shannon Wheeler, <i>God Is Disappointed in You</i> is a frequently hilarious, often shocking, but always accurate retelling of the Bible, including the parts selectively left out by Sunday School teachers and church sermons. </p> <p>Irreverent yet faithful, this book is a must-listen for anyone who wants to see past the fog of religious agendas and cultural debates to discover what the Bible really says.</p>";
