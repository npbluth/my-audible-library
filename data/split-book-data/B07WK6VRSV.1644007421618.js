window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>How far would you go to clear the name of the man convicted for your son’s death?&nbsp;</p> <p>Red blood stains the red soil of the Australian Northern Territory in this true crime thriller.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Less than 250,000 people live in the Northern Territory, an area more than twice the size of Texas. If you want to escape from civilisation, you don’t have to go far. But you can’t outrun the heat. Every year during October and November the sweltering climate can drive people wild; they call it ‘Suicide Season’, ‘Mango Madness’ or, more plainly, ‘The Build-up’.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>It’s during this blistering heat that Jim O’Connell’s body is found in a creek bed, mummified and with his genitals removed. But when a dubious plea deal buries the truth and puts Jim’s best mate, Philip Mather, behind bars for the crime, the victim’s parents seek to unravel it themselves to prove Philip’s innocence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Follow journalist Mark Whittaker’s journey into the murky heart of the Northern Territory as allegations of police corruption and judicial racism emerge and a shadowy figure known as The Vigilante lurks on the fringe of the investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><b>This series contains mature themes and graphic imagery, and listener discretion is advised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p>";
