window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This is the first volume in a series of true stories from \"[a]n extraordinary landscape populated with befuddled bears, hormonally-crazed elk, homicidal wild boars, hopelessly timid wolves, and nine million tourists, some of whom are clueless\". In Kim DeLozier’s world, when sedated wild black bears wake up unexpectedly in the back seat of a helicopter in mid-flight, or in his car as he’s driving down the highway, or in his office while he’s talking on the phone, it’s just another day in the park. You’ll love seeing Kim and a fellow ranger tested as they bravely take on the task of relocating 77 live skunks by sedating them with darts from homemade blowguns, especially when the pickup truck load of stinkers wakes up while still in transit. A hilarious, heartwarming, and heartbreaking memoir by the chief wildlife ranger in the number-one most popular family vacation destination in the USA, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. For over 30 years, Kim DeLozier acted as a referee in the wild, trying to protect millions of park visitors from one of the densest populations of wild black bears in America - and the bears from tourists who get too close. Written with <i>Wall Street Journal</i> best-selling author Carolyn Jourdan, who has several highly-regarded number-one Amazon best-sellers about the Smoky Mountains and Appalachia. </p>";
