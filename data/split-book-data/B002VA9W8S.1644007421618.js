window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>History buffs will rejoice at Jeff Shaara's latest foray into the glorious days of America's founding. This dramatic sequel to his best selling <i>Rise to Rebellion</i> continues his chronicle of the key characters of the American Revolution and animates some of the most compelling scenes in America's history: Washington's harrowing winter at Valley Forge, Benedict Arnold's tragic downfall, and the fiercely-fought battles at Trenton, Brandywine Creek, and Yorktown. Shaara draws his readers into the ethical and strategic dilemmas of his characters. More than simple events, the dates and battles are fleshed out in our imaginations as momentary choices that could easily have turned out differently even with the same actors. Shaara's sequel shows how the philosophical ideas of the Founding Fathers outgrew the library in the theater of war.</p>";
