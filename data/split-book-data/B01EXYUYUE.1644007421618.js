window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>True happiness is an \"inside job\". Look at a happy person's life and you don't see any magic or unicorns. There's nothing in them that isn't also in you. Though external realities can certainly play a role, happiness doesn't spring from what you have, what happens to you, the situation you are in, where you are, or anything else. In fact, if it was easy to be happy, this book would be a very short one! </p> <p>Happiness doesn't have much to do with money, with achievement, or with possessions, because plenty of people have all three and are still not happy. In this guide, we'll approach happiness not as something you have, but something you actively do, each and every day. </p> <p><i>The 7 Habits of Exceptionally Happy People</i> will help you to: </p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Understand and apply the key principles of living a happy life in an easy step-by-step way </li> <li>Let go of things, thoughts, behaviors, and people that do not serve you anymore </li> <li>Identify and use your unique strengths and virtues </li> <li>Realize that \"huffy fluffy\" concepts such as forgiveness, gratitude, and mindfulness are actually extremely powerful </li> <li>...and much more inside! </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Learn how to love your life and become a happier person today! Are you ready? </p>";
