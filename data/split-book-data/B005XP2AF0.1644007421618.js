window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In <i>A River Runs Through It</i>, Norman Maclean claims that “in my family, there is no clear line between religion and fly-fishing.” Nor is there a clear line between family and fly-fishing. It is the one activity where brother can connect with brother and father with son, bridging troubled relationships at the junction of great trout rivers in western Montana. In Maclean’s autobiographical novella, it is the river that makes them realize that life continues and all things are related.</p> <p>Just as Norman Maclean writes at the end of A River Runs Through It that he is “haunted by waters,” so have readers been haunted by his novella. A retired English professor who began writing fiction at the age of 70, Maclean produced what is now recognized as one of the classic American stories of the 20th century.</p> <p>Here, with \"A River Runs Through It\", are two Norman Maclean stories never before on audio:</p> <ul> <li>Logging and Pimping and “Your Pal, Jim”</li> <li>USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky</li> </ul>";
