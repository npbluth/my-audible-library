window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A haunting and hopeful tale of discovering light in even the darkest of places.</b> </p> <p>For his whole life, the boy has lived underground, in a basement with his parents, grandmother, sister, and brother. Before he was born, his family was disfigured by a fire. His sister wears a white mask to cover her burns. </p> <p>He spends his hours with his cactus, reading his book on insects, or touching the one ray of sunlight that filters in through a crack in the ceiling. Ever since his sister had a baby, everyone's been acting very strangely. The boy begins to wonder why they never say who the father is, about what happened before his own birth, about why they're shut away. </p> <p>A few days ago, some fireflies arrived in the basement. His grandma said, <i>There's no creature more amazing than one that can make its own light.</i> That light makes the boy want to escape, to know the outside world. Problem is, all the doors are locked. And he doesn't know how to get out.... </p>";
