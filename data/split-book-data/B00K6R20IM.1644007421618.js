window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A collection of outrageous stories by the stand-up comic, TV host, and inspiration for the movie <i>National Lampoon's Van Wilder</i>. </p> <p>Bert Kreischer doesn't know how to say \"no\". If he did, he wouldn't have gotten himself mixed up with a group of Russian mobsters on a class trip to Moscow, earning him his nickname \"The Machine\". He wouldn't have wrestled with a bear or swum with sharks on national television. He wouldn't have (possibly) smoked PCP with a star of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>. And he wouldn't have been named the Number-One Partier in the Nation by <i>Rolling Stone</i>, inspired the movie <i>National Lampoon\\'s Van Wilder</i>, or performed standup to sellout crowds across the country. </p> <p>The stories Kreischer shares in <i>Life of the Party</i> are a guidebook on how not to grow up. From his fraternity days at Florida State University, to his rise as a standup, to his marriage and first brushes with fatherhood, Kreischer shows you a path that may not lead you to maturity or personal growth. But it will lead you to a shitload of fun.</p>";
