window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Many well-loved modern stories have roots in the imaginations of the brothers Grimm, but do you know Rapunzel's real predicament, or Hansel and Gretel's gruesome revenge after eating an old woman out of house and home, or the lengths Cinderella's stepsisters would go to achieve the perfect fit? With these original tales, you'll discover the darker side of once upon a time. Mined from rich German folklore, Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm's fairy tales have become staples of childhood for generations - and the subject of both Jungian and Freudian analysis. This collection of seven of their original stories includes \"Briar Rose\", \"The Juniper Tree\", \"The White Snake\", and \"The Frog-Prince\". </p>";
