window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Nebula Award Winner, Novel, 2014 </b></p> <p>If J. J. Abrams, Margaret Atwood, and Alan Weisman collaborated on a novel…it might be this awesome.</p> <p>Area X has been cut off from the rest of the continent for decades. Nature has reclaimed the last vestiges of human civilization. The first expedition returned with reports of a pristine, Edenic landscape; all the members of the second expedition committed suicide; the third expedition died in a hail of gunfire as its members turned on one another; the members of the eleventh expedition returned as shadows of their former selves, and within months of their return, all had died of aggressive cancer.</p> <p>This is the twelfth expedition.</p> <p>Their group is made up of four women: An anthropologist, a surveyor, a psychologist - the de facto leader - and a biologist, who is our narrator. Their mission is to map the terrain and collect specimens; to record all their observations, scientific and otherwise, of their surroundings and of one another; and, above all, to avoid being contaminated by Area X itself.</p> <p>They arrive expecting the unexpected, and Area X delivers - they discover a massive topographic anomaly and life forms that surpass understanding - but it's the surprises that came across the border with them and the secrets the expedition members are keeping from one another that change everything.</p> <p>Cover artwork ©Paramount Pictures.
