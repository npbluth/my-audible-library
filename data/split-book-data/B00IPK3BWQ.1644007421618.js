window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>From a cofounder of Pixar Animation Studios - the Academy Award-winning studio behind <i>Coco</i>, <i>Inside Out</i>, and <i>Toy Story - </i>comes an incisive book about creativity in business and leadership for readers of Daniel Pink, Tom Peters, and Chip and Dan Heath.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>New York Times</i> best seller</p> <p>Named one of the best books of the year by <i>The Huffington Post</i> • <i>Financial Times</i> • <i>Success </i>• <i>Inc.</i> • <i>Library Journal</i></p> <p><i>Creativity, Inc. </i>is a manual for anyone who strives for originality and the first-ever all-access trip into the nerve center of Pixar Animation - into the meetings, postmortems, and “Braintrust” sessions where some of the most successful films in history are made. It is, at heart, a book about creativity - but it is also, as Pixar cofounder and president Ed Catmull writes, “an expression of the ideas that I believe make the best in us possible”.</p> <p>For nearly 20 years, Pixar has dominated the world of animation, producing such beloved films as the Toy Story trilogy, <i>Monsters, Inc.</i>, <i>Finding Nemo</i>, <i>The Incredibles</i>, <i>Up</i>, <i>WALL-E</i>, and <i>Inside Out</i>, which have gone on to set box-office records and garner 30 Academy Awards. The joyousness of the storytelling, the inventive plots, the emotional authenticity: In some ways, Pixar movies are an object lesson in what creativity really is. Here, in this book, Catmull reveals the ideals and techniques that have made Pixar so widely admired - and so profitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>As a young man, Ed Catmull had a dream: to make the first computer-animated movie. He nurtured that dream as a PhD student at the University of Utah, where many computer science pioneers got their start, and then forged a partnership with George Lucas that led, indirectly, to his cofounding Pixar in 1986. Nine years later, <i>Toy Story</i> was released, changing animation forever. The essential ingredient in that movie’s success - and in the 13 movies that followed - was the unique environment that Catmull and his colleagues built at Pixar, based on leadership and management philosophies that protect the creative process and defy convention, such as:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they will screw it up. But give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will either fix it or come up with something better.</li> <li>If you don’t strive to uncover what is unseen and understand its nature, you will be ill prepared to lead.</li> <li>It’s not the manager’s job to prevent risks. It’s the manager’s job to make it safe for others to take them.</li> <li>The cost of preventing errors is often far greater than the cost of fixing them.</li> <li>A company’s communication structure should not mirror its organizational structure. Everybody should be able to talk to anybody.</li> </ul>";
