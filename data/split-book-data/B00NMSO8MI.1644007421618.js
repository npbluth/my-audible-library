Greg's rugby-playing days are well and truly behind him, thanks to countless pints of beer and chicken curry. </p> <p>When Elise, a radio DJ and Zoe's best friend, tells them about a new competition, it seems like the perfect opportunity to turn their lives around. <i>Fat Chance</i> will pit six hefty couples against one another to see who can collectively lose the most weight and walk away with a £50,000 prize. </p> <p>So begins six months of abject misery, tears, and frustration—that just might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to them - in another laugh-out-loud look at the way we live now from bestselling author Nick Spalding.</p>";
