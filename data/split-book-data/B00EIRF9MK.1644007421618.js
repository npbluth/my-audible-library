But their relaxing tropical getaway soon turns into a murderous nightmare. </p><p>After an extravagant first night dinner, the guests retire to their lavish suites only to be awakened by an ear-splitting bang. They rush to the smoking parlor to find Jordan, the companyâ€™s intern, dead - a massive hole in his chest. Giles, the consummate English butler who seems to be in charge, announces that they must solve the crime or be the next victim. </p><p>The killer, who has booby-trapped the island and cut off phone and Internet connections, is hiding among them. Is it the HR representative with a penchant for Bloody Marys, the twenty-two-year-old claims processor with the purity ring, or perhaps the head chef of the company cafeteria? The killer plays with their minds, inviting them to explore the beautiful resort, from the infinity pool with the high dive to the white sand beach complete with jet skis and snorkel gear. </p><p>Anthony E.
