Please disregard any reviews mentioning poor audio quality prior to December 2019.</b></p> <p>Why do some products capture our attention, while others flop? What makes us engage with certain products out of habit? Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us? This audiobook introduces listeners to the \"Hooked Model\", a four-step process companies use to build customer habits. Through consecutive cycles through the hook, successful products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back repeatedly - without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.</p> <p><i>Hooked </i>is a guide to building products people use because they want to, not because they have to. Written for product managers, designers, marketers, startup founders, and people eager to learn more about the things that control our behaviors, this audiobook gives listeners:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Practical insights to create user habits that stick.</li> <li>Actionable steps for building products people love.</li> <li>Behavioral techniques used by Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and other habit-forming products.</li> <li><b>New </b>for second edition! An additional case study for building health habits.</li> </ul> <p>Nir Eyal distilled years of research, consulting, and practical experience to write a manual for creating habit-forming products. Nir has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and Hasso Plattner Institute of Design. His writing on technology, psychology, and business appears in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>TechCrunch</i>, and <i>Psychology Today</i>. He is also the author of <i>Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life</i>.</p>";
