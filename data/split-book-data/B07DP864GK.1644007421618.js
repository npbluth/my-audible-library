window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Captivating stories of the places where human evil has left a nefarious mark, featuring stories from the podcast </b><b><i>Lore </i></b><b>- now a streaming television series - including “Echoes”, “Withering Heights”, and “Behind Closed Doors”, as well as rare material.</b></p> <p>Sometimes you walk into a room, a building, or even a town, and you feel it. Something seems off - an atmosphere that leaves you oddly unsettled, with a sense of lingering darkness. Join Aaron Mahnke, the host of the popular podcast <i>Lore</i>, as he explores some of these dreadful places and the history that haunts them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Mahnke takes us to Colorado and the palatial Stanley Hotel, where wealthy guests enjoyed views of the Rocky Mountains at the turn of the 20th century - and where, decades later, a restless author would awaken from a nightmare, inspired to write one of the most revered horror novels of all time. Mahnke also crosses land and sea to visit frightful sites - from New Orleans to Richmond, Virginia, to the brooding, ancient castles of England - each with its own&nbsp;echoes of dark deeds, horrible tragedies, and shocking evil still resounding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Filled with evocative illustrations, this eerie tour of lurid landmarks and doomed destinations is just the ticket to take armchair travelers with a taste for the macabre to places they never thought they’d visit in their wildest, scariest dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The World of Lore series includes:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li><i>Monstrous Creatures </i></li> <li><i>Wicked Mortals </i></li> <li><i>Dreadful Places</i></li> </ul> <p>Praise for <i>World of Lore</i>: <i>Dreadful Places</i>:</p> <p>“Well-written, rooted in deep historical research, and ridiculously entertaining.... Each chapter brings a creepy story from folklore to life.... Hair-raising stuff.” (<i>SyFy Wire</i>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>“Fans of the <i>Lore </i>podcast won’t want to miss this latest volume in the creator’s series, a collection of illustrated versions of both rare and well-known stories about ‘lurid landmarks and doomed destinations.’” (<i>io9</i>)</p> <p>“<i>Dreadful Places</i> is a delight for <i>Lore </i>fans and newbies alike. In the book, [Aaron] Mahnke visits places around the world that are steeped in a supernatural legacy.” (<i>Refinery29</i>)</p>";
