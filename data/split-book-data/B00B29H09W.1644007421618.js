window.bookSummaryJSON = "<ul> <li>Don't worry about family dinner.</li> <li>Let your kids pick their punishments.</li> <li>Ditch the sex talk.</li> <li>Cancel date night.</li> </ul> <p>These are just a few of the surprising innovations in this bold first-of-its-kind playbook for today's families. Best-selling author and <i>New York Times</i> family columnist Bruce Feiler found himself squeezed between caring for aging parents and raising his children. So he set out on a three-year journey to find the smartest solutions and the most cutting-edge research about families. Instead of the usual family \"experts\", he sought out the most creative minds - from Silicon Valley to the set of <i>Modern Family,</i> from the country's top negotiators to the Green Berets - and asked them what team-building exercises and problem-solving techniques they use with their families. Feiler then tested these ideas with his wife and kids. The result is a fun, original look at how families can draw closer together, complete with 200 never-before-seen best practices. </p> <p>Feiler's life-changing discoveries include a radical plan to reshape your family in 20 minutes a week, Warren Buffett's guide for setting an allowance, and the Harvard handbook for resolving conflict. <i>The Secrets of Happy Families</i> is a timely, counterintuitive book that answers the questions countless parents are asking: How do we manage the chaos of our lives? How do we teach our kids values? How do we make our family happier? </p> <p>Written in a charming, accessible style, <i>The Secrets of Happy Families</i> is smart, funny, and fresh, and will forever change how your family lives every day.</p>";
