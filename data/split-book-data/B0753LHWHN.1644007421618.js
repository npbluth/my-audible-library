window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The best-selling author of <i>Smoke Gets in Your Eyes</i> expands our sense of what it means to treat the dead with \"dignity\". </p> <p>Fascinated by our pervasive terror of dead bodies, mortician Caitlin Doughty set out to discover how other cultures care for their dead. In rural Indonesia, she observes a man clean and dress his grandfather's mummified body. Grandpa's mummy has lived in the family home for two years, where the family has maintained a warm and respectful relationship. She meets Bolivian <i>natitas</i> (cigarette-smoking, wish-granting human skulls) and introduces us to a Japanese <i>kotsuage</i>, in which relatives use chopsticks to pluck their loved ones' bones from cremation ashes. </p> <p>With curiosity and morbid humor, Doughty encounters vividly decomposed bodies and participates in compelling, powerful death practices almost entirely unknown in America. <i>From Here to Eternity</i> introduces death-care innovators researching green burial and body composting, explores new spaces for mourning - including a glowing Buddha columbarium in Japan and America's only open-air pyre - and reveals unexpected new possibilities for our own death rituals. </p> <p>Author bio: Mortician Caitlin Doughty - host and creator of <i>Ask a Mortician</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Smoke Gets in Your Eyes</i> - founded the death acceptance collective The Order of the Good Death and cofounded Death Salon. She lives in Los Angeles, where she runs her nonprofit funeral home, Undertaking LA. </p>";
