window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Wars change, warriors don't.</p> <p>We are all warriors. Each of us struggles every day to define and defend our sense of purpose and integrity, to justify our existence on the planet, and to understand, if only within our own hearts, who we are and in what we believe.&nbsp;</p> <p>Do we fight by a code? If so, what is it? What is the warrior ethos? From where did it come? What form does it take today? How do we (and how can we) use it and be true to it in our internal and external lives?&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Warrior Ethos</i> is intended not only for men and women in uniform, but artists, entrepreneurs, and other warriors in other walks of life. The audiobook examines the evolution of the warrior code of honor and \"mental toughness\". It goes back to the ancient Spartans and Athenians, to Caesar's Romans, Alexander's Macedonians, and the Persians of Cyrus the Great (not excluding the Garden of Eden and the primitive hunting band).&nbsp;</p> <p>Sources include Herodotus, Thucydides, Plutarch, Xenophon, Vegetius, Arrian, and Curtius - and on down to Gen. George Patton, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, and Israeli Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan.</p>";
