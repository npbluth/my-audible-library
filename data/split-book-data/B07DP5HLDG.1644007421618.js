window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> is the longest major poem by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, written in 1797 to '98 and published in 1798 in the first edition of <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. Some modern editions use a revised version printed in 1817 that featured a gloss. Along with other poems in <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, it is often considered a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> relates the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage. The mariner stops a man who is on the way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The wedding-guest's reaction turns from bemusement to impatience to fear to fascination as the mariner's story progresses, as can be seen in the language style: Coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood in different parts of the poem.</p>";
