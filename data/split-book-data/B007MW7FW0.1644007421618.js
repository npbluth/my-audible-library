window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i></b><b>Bestseller</b></p> <p><b>The authors of </b><b><i>No-Drama Discipline</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Yes Brain</i></b><b> explain the new science of how a child’s brain is wired and how it matures in this pioneering, practical book.</b></p> <p><b>“Simple, smart, and effective solutions to your child’s struggles.” -Harvey Karp, M.D.</b></p> <p>In this pioneering, practical book, Daniel J. Siegel, neuropsychiatrist and author of the bestselling <i>Mindsight</i>, and parenting expert Tina Payne Bryson offer a revolutionary approach to child rearing with twelve key strategies that foster healthy brain development, leading to calmer, happier children. The authors explain - and make accessible - the new science of how a child’s brain is wired and how it matures. The “upstairs brain,” which makes decisions and balances emotions, is under construction until the mid-twenties. And especially in young children, the right brain and its emotions tend to rule over the logic of the left brain. No wonder kids throw tantrums, fight, or sulk in silence. By applying these discoveries to everyday parenting, you can turn any outburst, argument, or fear into a chance to integrate your child’s brain and foster vital growth.&nbsp;</p> <p>Complete with age-appropriate strategies for dealing with day-to-day struggles, <i>The Whole-Brain Child</i> shows you how to cultivate healthy emotional and intellectual development so that your children can lead balanced, meaningful, and connected lives.</p>";
