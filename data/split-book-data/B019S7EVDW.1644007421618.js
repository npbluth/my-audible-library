window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A dramatic insider account of the world of private military contracting.</b> </p> <p>Armored cars, burner phones, top-notch weaponry, and top-secret missions - this is the life of today's private military contractor. Like author Simon Chase, many PMCs were once the world's top military operatives, and since retiring from outfits like US Navy SEAL TEAM Six and the UK's Special Boat Service, they have devoted their lives to executing missions too sensitive for the government to acknowledge. </p> <p>Chase reveals here for the first time the operations too hazardous and politically volatile to be officially sanctioned by his employers. Working on behalf of the CIA's Special Activities Division, the US Department of Defense, the US State Department, and British government entities, he takes on jobs that require zero footprint, with no trace of their actions left behind. </p> <p>Chase delivers firsthand accounts of tracking Bin Laden in Afghanistan and being one of the first responders after the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi. We see his teams defuse terrorist bombs, guard dignitaries, and protect convoys traveling through perilous territory - and then there are the really big jobs: top-secret \"zero footprint\" missions for the US government that include searching for high-value targets and setting up arms shipping networks. </p> <p>The missions in <i>Zero Footprint</i> will shock listeners, but so will the personal dangers. Chase and the men he works with operate without government backup or air rescue. If they die serving their country - they remain anonymous. There are no military honors or benefits. Contractors like Simon Chase are the unsung heroes in the war against terrorism, a strong but largely invisible force - until now. </p>";
