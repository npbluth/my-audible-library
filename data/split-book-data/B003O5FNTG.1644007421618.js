window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this, his first audiobook, Tony Hsieh - the widely admired CEO of Zappos, the online shoe retailer - explains how he created a unique culture and commitment to service that aims to improve the lives of employees, customers, vendors, and backers. Using anecdotes and stories from his own life experiences, and from other companies, Hsieh provides concrete ways that companies can achieve unprecedented success. Even better, he shows how creating happiness and record results go hand-in-hand.</p> <p>He starts with the \"Why\" in a section where he narrates his quest to understand the science of happiness. Then he runs through the ten Zappos \"Core Values\" - such as \"Deliver WOW through Service\", \"Create Fun and A Little Weirdness\", and \"Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit\" - and explains how you and your colleagues should come up with your own.</p> <p>Hsieh then details many of the unique practices at Zappos that have made it the success it is today, such as their philosphy of allocating marketing money into the customer experience, thereby allowing repeat customers and word-of-mouth be their true form of marketing. He also explains why Zappos's number-one priority is company culture and his belief that once you get the culture right, everything else - great customer service, long-term branding - will happen on its own.</p> <p>Finally, <i>Delivering Happiness</i> explains how Zappos employees actually apply the Core Values to improving their lives outside of work - and to making a difference in their communities and the world.</p>";
