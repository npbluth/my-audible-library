window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Iron Man and Captain America are two core members of the Avengers, the world's greatest superhero team. But when a tragic battle blows a hole in the city of Stamford, killing hundreds of people, the US government demands that all superheroes unmask and register their powers. To Tony Stark - Iron Man - it's a regrettable but necessary step. To Captain America, it's an unbearable assault on civil liberties.&nbsp;</p> <p>This GraphicAudioÂ® Production is adapted from the graphic novel by Mark Millar and Steve McNiven.</p>";
