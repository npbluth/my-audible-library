window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“An epic reading experience.” (</b><b><i>San Diego Union-Tribune</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p>Acclaimed, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling fantasist Raymond E. Feist gets his masterful Serpentwar Saga off to a spectacular start with <i>Shadow of a Dark Queen</i>. Feist’s classic epic fantasy adventure returns listeners to ever-imperiled Midkemia, a breathtaking, richly imagined realm of magic and intrigue, where two unlikely heroes must rally the forces of the land to stand firm against a malevolent race of monsters intent upon conquest and annihilation.&nbsp;</p> <p><i>Locus</i> magazine calls <i>Shadow of a Dark Queen</i>, “the place to start for those yet to discover Feist’s fantasy worlds.” For fans of Terry Goodkind, George R. R. Martin, and Terry Brooks - and for anyone not already in the thrall of this astonishing author’s literary magic - that is excellent advice indeed.</p>";
