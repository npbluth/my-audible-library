window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Audie Award Winner, Nonfiction, 2014</b></p> <p>Explore the power of the underdog in Malcolm Gladwell's dazzling examination of success, motivation, and the role of adversity in shaping our lives, from the best-selling author of&nbsp;<i>The Bomber Mafia</i>.</p> <p>Three thousand years ago on a battlefield in ancient Palestine, a shepherd boy felled a mighty warrior with nothing more than a stone and a sling, and ever since then the names of David and Goliath have stood for battles between underdogs and giants. David's victory was improbable and miraculous. He shouldn't<i> </i>have won.</p> <p>Or should he have?</p> <p>In <i>David and Goliath</i>, Malcolm Gladwellchallenges how we think about obstacles and disadvantages, offering a new interpretation of what it means to be discriminated against, or cope with a disability, or lose a parent, or attend a mediocre school, or suffer from any number of other apparent setbacks.</p> <p>Gladwell begins with the real story of what happened between the giant and the shepherd boy those many years ago. From there, <i>David and Goliath</i> examines Northern Ireland's Troubles, the minds of cancer researchers and civil rights leaders, murder and the high costs of revenge, and the dynamics of successful and unsuccessful classrooms - all to demonstrate how much of what is beautiful and important in the world arises from what looks like suffering and adversity.</p> <p>In the tradition of Gladwell's previous best-sellers - <i>The Tipping Point</i>, <i>Blink</i>, <i>Outliers</i>, and <i>What the Dog Saw </i>-<i> David and Goliath</i> draws upon history, psychology, and powerful storytelling to reshape the way we think of the world around us.</p>";
